Functions are one of the fundamental concepts in computer programming. They are reusable blocks of code that can be called from different parts of a program. A function typically takes some inputs, performs a series of operations on those inputs, and then returns an output.

Functions are useful for several reasons. First, they allow us to break a complex program into smaller, more manageable pieces. By separating the logic of our program into smaller functions, we can make our code more modular and easier to maintain. Second, functions can be reused across different parts of a program or even in different programs altogether. This can save us time and effort by eliminating the need to rewrite the same code multiple times.

In most programming languages, functions can take any number of inputs, known as arguments. These arguments can be of different types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and even other functions. Inside a function, we can perform any operations we need on these inputs, including arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations.

Functions can also have a return value, which is the result of the operations performed inside the function. This return value can be of any type, depending on the operations performed inside the function. Once a function has finished executing, the return value is passed back to the part of the program that called the function.

In summary, functions are a powerful tool in computer programming that allow us to break complex programs into smaller, more manageable pieces, and to reuse code across different parts of a program or even in different programs altogether.
